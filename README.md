# Palette
A class with a list of 855 named colors that you can import into your Processing sketches.
All you need to do is to copy-paste it into your library folder, inside Processing's sketchbook directory.
Then, you just have to import it to your sketchs like you would with any other library (import overmind.Palette;).
